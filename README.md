# Pixel Retro 3D Game Framework (pr3d)

pr3d is in early stages of development and barely anything right now, but the goal is to be a code driven framework for making 3D games in the style of 90s retro consoles like the PS1, but without the limitations of the hardware and with support for scaling to modern resolutions in mind from the start.

pr3d is built on top of the [GLFW library](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
